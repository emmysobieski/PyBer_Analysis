 **Part One Challenge Analysis
 
 Conclusion: Density of the area explains number of drivers, number of rides, average fare per driver and average fare per ride.  Higher density results in shorter trips and a higher volume of trips and drivers.  While there are more rides in urban, the ride length and price per ride are less vs rural.  This makes sense because in cities, people are usually taking shorter trips, and there are more people taking trips.  For rural, there are less trips, but given bigger distances, the fare per trip is larger.
 
 Rural has the least number of rides at 125 and the least number of drivers at 78, however it is still likely worthwhile to have rurual service because the average fare per ride is the highest of all types of cities, and the average fare per driver is even higher  (rural fare per driver is 3.3X urban fare per driver) due to less drivers in rural vs urban).  Looking more closely, while the number of rides for urban is approx 13X the number of rides for rural, the number of drivers in urban is 30X the number in rural, which means more fares dollars to each driver in rural.  This all means rural drivers earn 3.3X the amount per ride as urban drivers.  Suburban is in the middle in density of population, number of rides, number of drivers, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
