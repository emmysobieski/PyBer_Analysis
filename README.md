**Part One Challenge Analysis**
 
Rides Summary DataFrame shows that rural has the least number of rides at 125 and the least number of drivers at 78, however it is still likely worthwhile to have rurual service because the average fare per ride in rural is the highest of all types of cities, and the average fare per driver is even higher  (rural fare per driver is 3.3X urban fare per driver) due to less drivers in rural vs urban).  Looking more closely, while the number of rides for urban is approx 13X the number of rides for rural, the number of drivers in urban is 30X the number in rural, which means more fares dollars to each driver in rural.  This all means rural drivers earn 3.3X the amount per ride as urban drivers.  Suburban is in the middle in density of population, number of rides, number of drivers, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

Conclusion: Density of the area explains number of drivers, number of rides, average fare per driver and average fare per ride.  Higher density results in shorter trips and a higher volume of trips and drivers.  While there are more rides in urban, the ride length and price per ride are less vs rural.  This makes sense because in cities, people are usually taking shorter trips, and there are more people taking trips.  For rural, there are less trips, but given bigger distances, the fare per trip is larger.
 
 **Part Two Challenge Analysis**
 
The Multiple Line Chart shows 3 lines, the top one for urban, the next for suburban, and the lowest line for rural.  It shows total fares for each city type summed up for each week for the period Jan 1, 2019 to April 28, 2019.  Urban always has the highest number of total weekly fares and suburban has the next highest line representing total weekly fares in suburban areas, and rural has the lowest total weekly fares each week for the period mentioned.

In terms of week-to-week volatility, each area has a spike in total fares over Presidents Weekend.  There are less reliable spikes over Martin Luther King Weekend, which makes sense as often Presidents is a 4 day weekend and more broadly used for travel and celebration.  In general the rural areas are the most stable, with a range from $68 to $500, whereas suburban has the largest range and urban is in the middle.  This makes sense because urban will be more variable around more frequent conferences and events as well as holidays, whereas suburban will have less frequent events thus more volatility of fares around the events that they do celebrate, which is seen where they have the both largest percentage spike in total fares and then reduction in total fares coinciding with the beginning and end of Presidents Weekend.

Finally, further supporting the stability of rural, you can see that after New Years, there is a typical early January lull in total fares in urban and suburban, but rural is more consistent.

# Overall conclusion
From both these charts, there are good reasons to keep rideshare business diversified across city types.  Rural has less total fares but can pay better per driver and is less volatile.  Urban brings in the highest revenue and can still support drivers as many use this as one of thier part time jobs, and with more fares available, they can work more hours vs rural drivers.  Suburban is the large pie in the middle, having more drivers and higher total fares than rural and less than suburban.
